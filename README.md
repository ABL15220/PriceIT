This is my ssecond website with Flask: 

On this website my hope is for the user to able to input any type of product (car, phone, lamp...) and for the program to scan the internet, find all matching products,
give the user the maximum, minimum and average price of the product linking the website with the cheapest, official and most expensive websites where you can find the 
exact product.
